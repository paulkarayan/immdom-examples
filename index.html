<h2 id="imminentdomainexamples">Imminent Domain Examples</h2>
<p>Here are a set of examples built on Next.js that should happily deploy to Vercel.
The intention is to demonstrate the sorts of things you can do with Imminent Domain.</p>
<h2 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h2>
<h3 id="runlocally">Run Locally</h3>
<p>First, cd into the example's directory you'd like to run. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">cd basic-api
</code></pre>
<p>Then run the development server:</p>
<pre><code class="bash language-bash">npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
</code></pre>
<p>Open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> with your browser to see the result.</p>
<h3 id="deploytovercel">Deploy to Vercel</h3>
<p>The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the <a href="https://vercel.com/import?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme">Vercel Platform</a> from the creators of Next.js.</p>
<p>At some point, we'll put links to make this trivially easy in all the example directories.</p>
<h2 id="whatisimminentdomain">What is Imminent Domain?</h2>
<p align="center">

</p>
<p>Imminent Domain (ImmDom) is an Open Source, community-run software platform.
Our purpose is to accelerate software product development with the sole KPI (key performance indicator)
of Time From Idea to MVP (well - you can argue "time to iteration step" more broadly. work with me, people!)</p>
<p>To accomplish this goal, we curate best of breed tech and build our own where it's needed.</p>
<p>The Foundation Project (forthcoming) has focused around rapid infrastructure build out,
centered around enabling technologies like AWS/GCP and Terraform. We also provide
tutorials and educational materials such as these examples.</p>
<h2 id="otherthings">Other Things</h2>
<h3 id="wishlist">Wish List</h3>
<p>We welcome your thoughts on how to achieve our state goal, as well as your contributions.</p>
<p>Please use Github Issues to request additional examples, features, or to file bugs.
We'd also love to showcase community examples. We won't bite - promise!</p>
<h3 id="generatingthesite">Generating the Site</h3>
<p>We use Showdown.</p>
<p>npm install showdown -g
showdown makehtml -i README.md -o index.html</p>
<p>then copy the code into "dummy"</p>
<p>and then add CSS from
https://markdowncss.github.io/</p>
<h3 id="catalogueofexamples">Catalogue of Examples</h3>
<p>Links to the projects will go here. Later we'll make this a webapp itself!</p>
<h3 id="sponsors">Sponsors</h3>
<p>(not really sponsored by but the logo is cool - and we are looking for people to help us spread the news!)</p>
